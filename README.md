*This mod works only on Fabric and Quilt!*

## Commands (and permissions):
- `/styledplayerlist` - Main command (`styledplayerlist.main`, available by default)
- `/styledplayerlist reload` - Reloads configuration and styles (requires `styledplayerlist.reload`)
- `/styledplayerlist switch <style>` or `/plstyle <style>` - Changes selected style (`styledplayerlist.switch`, available by default)
- `/styledplayerlist switchothers <players> <style> ` - Changes selected style of players (`styledplayerlist.switch.others`)

## Configuration:
You can find config file in `./config/styledplayerlist/`.
Some config options allow for dynamic predicates (marked as `{/* PREDICATE */}`).
See [this page](https://github.com/Patbox/PredicateAPI/blob/1.19.4/BUILTIN.md) for more details.
[Formatting uses PlaceholderAPI's Text Parser for which docs you can find here](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/).

### Styles:
This mod allows having multiple styles, that can be selected by players (just put them in `./config/styledplayerlist/styles/` and use `/styledplayerlist reload` command)

```json5
{
  // Predicate required for usage of this style, required by player
  "require": {/* PREDICATE */},
  // Style name used for display
  "style_name": "Default",
  // Time between updates of the style in ticks. 20 is 1 second. Used for formatting and placeholders
  "update_tick_time": 20,
  // Header of player list style, using simple/static definition (works in "list_footer" too). Allows formatting
  "list_header": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ],
  // Footer of player list style, using animated definition (works in "list_header" too). Allows formatting
  "list_footer": {
    // Number of changes required to change into next frame. This means it updates every (change_rate * update_tick_time) ticks 
    "change_rate": 1,
    // Frames of displayed text. There is no limit for amount of them
    "values": [
      [
        "<red>..."
      ],
      [
        "<blue>..."
      ]
    ],
  },
  // Makes this style hidden from autocompletion, without changing requirements
  "hidden_in_commands": false
}
```
